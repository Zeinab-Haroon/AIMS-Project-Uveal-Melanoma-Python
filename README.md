The final Thesis at AIMS-Cameroon

In this essay, we investigated the optic nerve shape changes under different gaze angles to improve the proton therapy planning for uveal melanoma patients by developing a segmentation algorithm in 3T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The feasibility of changing the optic nerve shape under different gaze angles was confirmed. The relative gaze angles have also been calculated for the nine gaze images. Future research will focus on gaze angle interpolation to find the optimal gaze angle that enables the algorithm to be used for further eye-model development, which can enhance the proton therapy planning for uveal melanoma patients.
