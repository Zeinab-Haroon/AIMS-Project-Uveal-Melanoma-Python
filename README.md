The final Thesis at AIMS-Cameroon

In this essay, we investigated the optic nerve shape changes under different gaze angles to improve the proton therapy planning for uveal melanoma patients by developing a segmentation algorithm in 3T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The feasibility of having the optic nerve shape changes under different gaze angles were confirmed. The relative gaze angles have been calculated for the nine gaze images as well. The future research will focus on gaze angles interpolation to find the optimal gaze angle that enables algorithm to be used for further eye-model development which can enhance the proton therapy planning for uveal melanoma patients.
